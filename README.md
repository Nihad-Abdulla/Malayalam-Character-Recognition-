Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize and digitize handwritten Malayalam characters. Malayalam, a Dravidian language with 53 unique characters, including vowels and consonants, presents challenges for character recognition due to the diverse styles of handwriting.

The project draws inspiration from Optical Character Recognition (OCR), commonly used for printed text. However, traditional OCR methods struggle with handwritten text, especially for regional scripts like Malayalam. To address this, the project uses CNNs, which excel in image recognition by identifying patterns and features. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of handwritten Malayalam characters, using techniques like image pre-processing, grayscale conversion, and noise reduction to enhance recognition accuracy and classify characters based on their visual features.
