Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can recognize and digitize handwritten Malayalam characters using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Malayalam, a Dravidian language spoken predominantly in Kerala, India, has a script with 53 unique characters, including vowels and consonants. Due to the diverse handwriting styles and shapes of these characters, recognizing them accurately is a challenging task.

The character recognition method in this project is inspired by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, which is commonly used for printed text. However, traditional OCR techniques often fail with handwritten text, especially in regional languages like Malayalam. To overcome this, the project employs deep learning techniques such as CNNs, which excel at recognizing patterns and features in images. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of handwritten Malayalam characters to classify each character based on its unique visual features. Image pre-processing techniques, such as grayscale conversion and noise reduction, are also used to improve recognition accuracy.
